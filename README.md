# Image Metadata Analysis - Database Loader Tool
This command-line tool scans a specified folder (or all libraries if no folder is provided) for image files, and using the powerful ExifTool utility- extracts the metadata, and updates a SQLite database accordingly. It does not alter the file metadata. The tool and database is designed for users with knowledge of SQL and photo metadata, allowing them to analyze the metadata of their photo collections.


## Installation

1. Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
   - .NET Core SDK 8
   - EXIFTool.exe installed (https://exiftool.org/) - Include the exiftool.exe folder in your system's PATH folder.

2. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/josemoliver/ImageDB.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd ImageDB
   ```

4. Restore the project dependencies:
   ```
   dotnet restore
   ```

5. Build the project included under "console" folder:
   ```
   dotnet build
   ```

## Setup and Usage

1. Use a SQLite Database Editor such as SQLite DB Browser (https://sqlitebrowser.org/). 
2. Create SQLite Database (Example name ImageDB.sqlite) by running the database\ImageDB.sqlite.sql file. This will create all the tables, views and indexes.
3. Update the appsettings.json file with the path of your SQLite database file. You can also include folder paths to ingore. For example, some database management tools may create temp folders for deleted files you may wish not to include in the database. 
4. Open database and add your photo collection folders to the PhotoLibrary table. For example, you may have a divided your photo collections into folders based on Years.
5. Ensure exiftool.exe is properly installed and included in your system's PATH environment variable.
6. Run ImageDB.exe refer to the options.


The Image Database Management Tool provides the following command-line options:

- `--mode`: (Required) Operation modes [ normal | date | quick | reload ]
- `--folder`: (Optional) Specify the path to a specific library to scan. Paths must be included in the PhotoLibrary db table. Leaving value empty will run through all library folders.


## Operation Modes:

| Options         | Description                                             |
| :------------     | :--------------------------------------------------------- | 
| `normal`     | Scans all files and compares any existing file using SHA1 hash. Slowest scanning mode but the most reliable.|
| `date`       | Scans all files and updates the files based on the file modified date property. Faster scanning but if any file was updated and the file modified date is not, the app will not update the metatada on the database. |
|  `quick` | Scans files based on file modified sorted by descending modified date. If unmodified file if found, the rest are skipped. |
|  `reload` |No scan is performed of the files, existing metadata scans are re-processed at the database level. This mode is useful for updating  the database tables after any code modification. |


To run the tool, use the following command:

```
ImageDB.exe --mode [options] --folder [path]
```

For example, to perform a normal scan for a specific folder, included in the PhotoLibrary db table:

```
ImageDB.exe --folder "C:\Users\YourUsername\Pictures"
```

Metadata Analisis:
Using a SQLlite database management tool, open the database file so you can analyze your photo file's metadata.

## DB Tables:

| Table            | Description                                             |
| :------------     | :--------------------------------------------------------- | 
| `Batch`     | Log of ImageDB runs. Files scanned, processed count, and duration of scan runs. |
| `Image`    | Image metadata table. Includes tables with derived data from file metadata (For example, date and Device). The column Metadata contains the exiftool JSON output of the files with all the key/value pairs found by Exiftool. Detailed descriptions can be found in exiftool.org. |
| `Log`  |  Error/Warning logs |
| `Location`          | Location Identifiers found. If a photo metadata uses IPTC Location Identifiers. Refer to blog post: https://jmoliver.wordpress.com/2016/03/18/using-iptc-location-identifiers-to-link-your-photos-to-knowledge-bases/ |
| `MetadataHistory`          | Prior to updating a record on the Image table, the exiftool JSON Metdata is copied to this table for archiving purposes. Say you wish to figure out what metadata fields have been changed by your photo management softare or wish. |
| `PeopleTag`  |  People tags. |
| `PhotoLibrary`  |  Your photo collection main folders. All files and subfolder contained are scan by the tool. |
| `Tag`  |  Descriptive tags |
| `Region`  |  Metadata Working Group (MWG) Regions |
| `relation*`  | These tables maintain the ImageId relationships between tags, location identifiers, and people tags. |


## Metadata Table Fields:
Although all the metadata tags retrieved using Exiftool are loaded into `Metadata` field and accessible for queries and views, some other table values in the database are derived based on those fields for easier presentation. If various fields correspond to the same property the first non-empty/null value is used. For example, in the case of Image.Title the order of precedence is "XMP-dc:Title,IPTC:ObjectName, or IFD0:XPTitle". Other values are derived from merging similar values such as PeopleTag.PersonName or derived from a combination of fields as in the case of Image.Device.

| Table.Column            | Source(s)                            |
| :------------     | :--------------------------------------------------------- |

## DB Views:
The views are meant to assist in your metadata inspection and analysis. For example, identifying field discrepancies, finding duplicate filenames, etc. You will note that the exiftool JSON output can be queried using SQLite's Json Query Support - https://sqlite.org/json1.html. Feel free to edit existing ones or create your own.

## Example usage:
- WindowsXP Legacy Image Fields - Prior to better image photo metadata standards, Microsoft introduced as as part of the Windows XP operating system (released in 2001) to store descriptive metadata about images (and some other file types) in a way that supported Unicode text. The WindowsXP XPTitle, XPSubject, XPComment, XPAuthor and XPKeywords are stored in the EXIF tag space, but are not part of the official EXIF standard. They were intended to enable users to tag and search images using Windows Explorer, and are supported still by some applications. Use the vLegacyWindowsXP view to identify files containing data in these fields. Usefull if migrating your photo collection from apps such as Windows Photo Gallery - Refer to blog post: https://jmoliver.wordpress.com/2017/02/12/accessing-windows-photo-gallery-metadata-using-exiftool/
- IPTC IIM â€“ Developed in the 1990s, the IPTC IIM metadata standard was widely used in journalism and media. Although it has largely been replaced by newer formats like XMP, it remains supported by many tools for backward compatibility. To view IPTC IIM metadata in your images, use the vLegacy_IPTC_IMM view. 
- MWG Region mistmatch - Cropping or resizing images can lead to inconsistencies in MWG Region metadata. Refer to page 51 of the MWG Guidance document for details. The vRegionMismatch view checks whether the AppliedToDimensions values in MWG Regions match the actual image dimensions and flags any discrepancies.
- Reports for miscellaneous photo metadata such as Weather Tags (vWeatherTags) - https://jmoliver.wordpress.com/2018/07/07/capturing-the-moment-and-the-ambient-weather-information-in-photos/
